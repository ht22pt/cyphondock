.. _development:

#######################
Development Environment
#######################

Unlike the :ref:`production environment<production>`, the dev environment builds the images for Cyphon using local files. You'll need to download the Cyphon GitHub repository into the ``/opt/cyphon/cyphon`` directory so these files are available to Docker Compose::

    $ git clone https://github.com/dunbarcyber/cyphon.git /opt/cyphon/cyphon

Settings for the dev environment are contained in the 
``docker-compose.dev.yml`` file. To use the dev environment, you must 
specify both the base configuration file and the dev configuration file 
when starting the containers::

    $ cd /opt/cyphon/cyphondock
    $ sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

Use the ``-d`` flag if you want to start the containers in the 
background.


.. _dev-superuser:

*********
Superuser
*********

The dev environment will create a Cyphon superuser using the ``CYPHON_USERNAME`` and ``CYPHON_PASSWORD`` settings defined in your `.config/env/cyphon.env <https://github.com/dunbarcyber/cyphondock/blob/master/config-COPYME/env/cyphon.env#L1-L2>`__ file, if that user does not already exist.


.. _dev-ports:

*****
Ports
*****

The dev environment maps the exposed ports in the containers to random 
free ports on the host. This prevents any problems with ports already 
in use on the host. Once the docker containers are running, you can 
list the containers to see which ports on the host are being used for 
the various services::

    $ sudo docker ps -a

For example, the Kibana container exposes port 5601, but that port will 
be mapped to a random port on the host machine. If the port mapping for 
the Kibana container is ``0.0.0.0:32775->5601/tcp``, you would visit 
``http://localhost:32775`` in your web browser to access Kibana.


.. _dev-volumes:

************
Data Volumes
************

Unlike the :ref:`production environment<prod-volumes>`, the dev environment does not assign 
any specific host directories to store data from PostgreSQL, 
Elasticsearch, or MongoDB. Instead, it allows those services to 
automatically configure the locations for their data volumes. This 
prevents any confusion of dev and production data if the production 
environment is used at a later time. See Docker's `documentation <https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/>`_ to learn more about data volumes.
